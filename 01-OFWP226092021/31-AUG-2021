Introduction
------------
Spring is a Framework, Struts is also an Framework. Struts Framework support developing only web applications, it doesnt support any other application development types apart from Web Application.

In a typical web application there are 3 types of logics we write, which is also refered as 3 tiers/layers.
1. presentation-tier logic = The code/logic we write in interacting with the end-user of the application.
2. business-tier logic = The code/logic we write in computing the output by using the data
3. persistence-tier logic = the logic we write for storing/accessing the data from the persistence storage devices like database or file 

While working with Struts Framework, it helps us in developing Presentation-tier aspects of developing an web application, it doesn't support building business/persistence-tier of an web application.
Struts is not a Framework that support building end-to-end application development, it only helps us in building Presentation-tier aspects only, so it is not a complete framework.
  
Unlike Struts, Spring Framework supports not only developing web application, it supports multiple application development types.
